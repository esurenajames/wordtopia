    <h1 style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 36px; font-style: bold;">What are Homonyms?</h1>
    <p>The term <b>‘homonym’</b> comes from the Greek word <b>“homos”</b>, which means same and <b>“onoma”</b>, which means name. Homonyms are words that have the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings and origins. They can belong to the same or different parts of speech.</p>
    <p>Homonyms are words that have the same spelling and pronunciation but different meanings. They can be a source of confusion in language, as people may use a homonym in the wrong context without realizing it. For example, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution, or it can refer to the side of a river. Another example is the word "bear," which can refer to the animal or to "bearing" something heavy. Homonyms can be challenging for language learners, as they require an understanding of context to determine the correct meaning.</p>
    <p>Homonyms can be further classified into two types: homophones and homographs. Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings, such as "write" and "right." Homographs are words that are spelled the same but have different meanings and may or may not sound the same, such as "lead," which can refer to the metal or to leading a group of people. Homonyms can be found in many languages, and they are an important aspect of vocabulary acquisition and language learning.</p>
